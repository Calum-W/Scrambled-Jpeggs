Understand the flow in swift


Day 2 - Tuesday

What did we do:

Discussed Fizzbuzz challenge
Sam and Cal started learning how to build the app
Xin and George started learning how to test it

What did we learn:

How to add elements to the storyboard and manipulate them
Lots of Swift syntax

What did we do:

Stand up in the morning discussing how to proceed
Sam & Cal worked on trying to put a picture on the board
Xin & George worked on testing UI

What did we learn:

Adding images to the view
Debugging in Xcode
Feature testing

What to do next:

Continue building the app using TDD
Think about features to add to the app

Day 4 - Thursday

What we did:

Stand up
Started to TDD the app
Makeblocks + random
Putting 1/16 of the default picture on each block

What we learned:

You can put images into an array if they are in the assets folder

What we did:
Add photo update and camera function
Split uploaded images into array of images and put them into puzzle bloacks
Add scramble function
Add movement of blocks
